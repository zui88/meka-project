* Matlab

** Deep Learning Toolbox

   Was sind die Vorteile / Was bietet es:

   - Framework in Matlab fuer neuronale Netze
   - graphisches Tool fuer Entwurf
   - Tensor Flow kompatibel (ob wichtig???)
   - GPU Support

   Fragen:

   - wie das Ergebnis ueber die Schnittstelle versenden?

** Transfer CNN In MATLAB

   Transfer learning outlines the steps for getting a pretrained
   network, modifying and leveraging it.

   - extract the layers
     =lgraph = layerGraph(net)=
   - customize the fully connected layer
     n stands for number of neurons (nof = classifier)
     =fclayer = fullyConnectedLayer(n,"Name","lyname")=
   - replace the layer
     =lg = replaceLayer(lg,...=
     ="NameToReplace",newlayer)=
   - matching the output layer to the previous layers
     =cl = classificationLayer("Name","lyname")=
   - replace the last layer with the new one
     
** Transfer-Learning With DeepLearning Toolbox

*** mini-batch

    At each iteration, a subset of the training images, known as a
    mini-batch, is used to update the weights. Each iteration uses a
    different mini-batch. Once the whole training set has been used,
    that's known as an epoch.

*** Goal

    The Goal ist to minimize the loss-function.

*** Validation Data Are Used In Training

    provide a set of validation data for validate the training. If the
    training results getting worse, you have to abbort the
    training. -> danger of overfitting
